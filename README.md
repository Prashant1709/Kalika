# Period poverty

- Lack of sanitary facilities, menstrual products and education
- People who experience this often have to miss going to work or school .
- It has been estimated that 1 out of 5 girls drop out of school after they start menstruating.
- While an average of more than 40% of students in India resort to missing school while menstruating because of social stigma, isolation, embarrassment, and inaccessibility of period products.
- Period poverty cannot simply end by giving girls sanitary products though, society as a whole needs to be educated about periods so period poverty can end. This app is aimed at that.
